#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems. It involves the design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance of software products. Software engineering is important in the technology industry because it enables the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life, including communication, commerce, entertainment, and healthcare.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1) 1940s and 1950s - the first digital computers emerged.
2) 1960s - programming languages emerged and sftware development was introduced as a discipline.
3) 1970s - structured programming emerged.
4) 2000s - agile methodologies emerged

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
- Requirements: Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
- Design: Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
- Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
- Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
- Deployment: Releasing the software to users or customers.
- Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
- Waterfall: Sequential approach with distinct phases (e.g., requirements, design, implementation) flowing downwards like a waterfall. This methodology is more appropriate in scenarios such as regulated industries, projects with fixed requirements, and large-scale government projects where contracts demand detailed upfront specifications.
- Agile: Iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration, and responding to change. This method is more appropriate in scenrios such as in software startups where requirements evolve based on user feedback, in customer-driven projects requiring frequent updates, and in complex projects where solutions are not fully known at the start.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
- Software Developer: Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions. 
- Quality Assurance Engineer: Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
- Project Manager: Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects. - System Architect: Designs the overall structure and architecture of software systems.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
- Integrated Development Environments (IDEs): Software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code (e.g., Visual Studio, Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA). IDEs increase developer productivity by combining capabilities such as software editing, building, testing, and packaging in an easy-to-use application.
-  Version Control Systems (VCS): Software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members (e.g., Git, Subversion). VCS allows developers to track and manage changes to code over time, enabling collaboration, efficient bug fixing, and the ability to revert to previous versions if needed, ultimately improving code quality and project stability.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
 challenges:
- Changing Requirements: Requirements may change during the development cycle, leading to scope creep and project delays.
- Tight Deadlines: Pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality.
- Technical Debt: Accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions, technical debt can impede future development efforts and increase maintenance costs.
  Strategies:
  -Effective communication
  -Agile methods
  -Prioritization of tasks
  -Regular reassessment of project goals and timelines

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
- Unit Testing: Testing individual components or modules of software. Unit testing is important because it helps detect and fix defects early in development
- Integration Testing: Testing interactions between different components or subsystems. Integrated tetsing is important because it helps find interface defects between modules and ensures that different parts of the software work together seamlessly
- System Testing: Testing the entire software system as a whole. This is important because it helps ensure the whole system meets the requirements. 
- Acceptance Testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs. It is important becuse it reduces the risk of post-launch failure.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process of crafting and refining inputs (prompts) to optimize an AI modelâ€™s responses. It involves structuring questions, providing context, and using specific instructions to achieve accurate, relevant, and useful outputs from AI systems like ChatGPT, Bard, or Claude. The importance of prompt engineering in interacting with AI models include enhancing AI response quality, optimizing efficiency and reducing errors, and improves AI-assisted development and content creation.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt:
"Tell me about climate change"
Improved prompt:
"Explain the causes of climate change and it's impacts on agriculture in Kenya, with recent examples"
The improved prompt is more effective because it is more specific (it focuses on causes and impacts on agriculture, eliminating unnecessary details), it is clear and concise.
